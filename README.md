# Auto-Channel-Name-Adder-Telegram-Bot

## This is the telegram bot that can add links automaticly to your post and send it to your channel. 

### In order to use bot change API_TOKEN variable data to your Token and channel_id to your Chat ID . I use dotenv for this project. If you want you can use it too. You just need to create a .env file in the root directory.

### For using this app just install all dependencies inside **requirements.txt**. Write following command to installing all dependencies

> pip install -r requirements.txt
